High Torque: Adopting high quality motor steel material,with high torque 13Ncm(18.4oz.in), low self-inductance reactance, responsive and can avoid system error.
Low Resistance: Usongshine stepper motor can get a lower resistance value compared to motors of the same thickness and torque. This considerably increases the thermal conductivity of the motor. This effectively reduces the increase in temperature.
